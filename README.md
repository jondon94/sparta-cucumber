## Web Testing

**Introduction**

>This Repo is to learn how to use Cucumber and why it is ideal for businesses to use it for communication. I used a link tot he BBC website and went through the process of signing in and logging out and a creating an account.

**Setup**
>To set up this file on your machine and run tests, simply clone the repo in to your terminal and open the file in your IDE. Adding more tests is simple as cucumber is designed for reproducibility. Simply follow the structure of the existing tests and go through the process of adding tests.
>>Initialise Cucumber in the terminal by typing 'cucumber --init', this will create the relevant folders where certain files will go.
>>>In the Pages folder there are multiple .rb files. These are where the functions we intend to test are. Follow the structure of the existing tests to either add more test to an existing file or create a new file entirely for testing.
>>>>Include the new functions as a scenario in the feature file and name it <name>.feature. Write out the scenario in the file using Given/When/Then/And statements. And run that file in the terminal.
From there the results can c=be copied and pated in the step definitions folder and the functions of the tests from the .rb file can be inserted u to the relevant scenarios.
